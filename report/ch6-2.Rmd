# 6.2 National surveys of costs faced by TB patients and their households   

_Draft! Prepared `r Sys.Date()` using country-reported data CSV files dated `r csv_datestamp`_  

The World Health Organization (WHO) End TB Strategy includes the target that no tuberculosis (TB) patients and their households face catastrophic total costs because of TB disease. Total costs are defined as the sum of direct medical expenditures, direct nonmedical expenditures and indirect costs (e.g. income losses). This target was set because everyone who develops TB disease needs to be able to access diagnosis and treatment, and if this is not ensured the End TB Strategy targets for reductions in TB disease burden (incidence and mortality) will not be achieved.

WHO has established standard methods for conducting a national survey to assess the direct and indirect costs incurred by people with TB and their households (TB patient cost surveys) (`r ref_lnk("1")`). Since 2015, there has been substantial progress in the planning and implementation of national TB patient cost surveys (`r lnk("Fig. 6.2.1")`).

By September `r report_year`, 29 countries had completed a survey (`r lnk("Fig. 6.2.2")`).

<br />
In the `r nrow(f6.2.3a_txt_num)` surveys for which results have been reported, the percentage of TB patients and their households that experienced catastrophic total costs (defined as >20% of household expenditure or income) ranged from `r ftb(f6.2.3a_txt_lo$catast_pct)`% (95% confidence interval [CI]: `r ftb(f6.2.3a_txt_lo$catast_pct_lo)`–`r ftb(f6.2.3a_txt_lo$catast_pct_hi)`%) in `r f6.2.3a_txt_lo$country` to `r ftb(f6.2.3a_txt_hi$catast_pct)`% (95% CI: `r ftb(f6.2.3a_txt_hi$catast_pct_lo)`–`r ftb(f6.2.3a_txt_hi$catast_pct_hi)`%) in `r f6.2.3a_txt_hi$country` (`r lnk("Fig. 6.2.3")`). The pooled average for all `r nrow(f6.2.3a_txt_num)` countries, weighted for each country’s number of notified cases, was `r ftb(f6.2.3a_txt$catast_pct)`% (95% CI: `r ftb(f6.2.3a_txt$catast_pct_lo)`–`r ftb(f6.2.3a_txt$catast_pct_hi)`%). Among `r nrow(f6.2.3c_txt_num)` countries that reported disaggregated data, the percentage facing catastrophic total costs was much higher for people with drug-resistant TB (DR-TB), with a pooled average of `r ftb(f6.2.3c_txt$catast_pct)`% (95% CI: `r ftb(f6.2.3c_txt$catast_pct_lo)`–`r ftb(f6.2.3c_txt$catast_pct_hi)`%).

The distribution of costs faced by TB patients and their households varies among countries (`r lnk("Fig. 6.2.4")`). However, it was evident that – despite the widespread norm of “free TB care” policies – TB-affected households still face direct medical costs. Such costs accounted for a sizeable proportion of total costs in some countries (e.g. `r sub("Democratic", "the Democratic", knitr::combine_words(f6.2.4_txt_med$country, oxford_comma=FALSE))`). Minimizing direct medical costs borne by TB patients should be a high priority for national TB programmes (NTPs) and ministries of health.

<br />
The surveys also showed that actions are needed to eliminate direct nonmedical costs and to reduce indirect costs. The combined cost of transportation, food, nutritional supplements and other nonmedical expenditures (“direct nonmedical costs”) accounted for a substantial share (50% or more) of total costs in some countries, including `r gsub("(Philip)|(Democratic)|(United)", "the \\1\\2\\3", knitr::combine_words(f6.2.4_txt_nmed$country, oxford_comma=FALSE))`. Indirect costs associated with loss of employment or time lost while seeking or staying in care accounted for the largest single share of total costs in `r gsub("(Philip)|(Democratic)|(Russian)", "the \\1\\2\\3", knitr::combine_words(f6.2.4_txt_indirect$country, oxford_comma=FALSE))`.

All cost categories are influenced by the model of TB care; for example, to what extent there is reliance on hospitalization or outpatient care, the frequency with which attendance at health facilities is requested and the level to which services are decentralized to bring the services close to the community. They are also influenced by ease of access to the health facilities used to provide care.

Social protection is required to mitigate or eliminate direct nonmedical costs and indirect costs. Only 16 of the 30 high TB burden countries have a national policy that is specifically related to social protection for people with TB (`r lnk("Table 6.2.1")`). Free access to medical services is the most commonly-used measure (15/16 countries); at least one other form of social protection (such as cash transfers, enablers to adhere to treatment, support to help with food security) is provided in 14 countries.
