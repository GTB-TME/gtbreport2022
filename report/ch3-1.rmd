# 3.1 Case notifications  


_Draft! Prepared `r Sys.Date()` using country-reported data CSV files dated `r csv_datestamp` `r if(show_estimates){paste0('and estimates files dated ', csv_estimate_datestamp)}`_

Data on the number of people diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB), based on standard case definitions and associated guidance on the recording and reporting of data provided by WHO, have been systematically collected at national level and then reported to WHO on an annual basis since the mid-1990s.
Globally in 2021, `r ftb(t3.1.1_global$c_newinc/1e6)` million people with a new episode of TB (new and relapse cases) were diagnosed and notified (`r lnk("Table 3.1.1")`). Of these, `r ftb(t3.1.1_txt$c_pulm_p)`% had pulmonary TB. Collectively, the African, South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions accounted for almost `r ceiling(t3.1.1_txt$c_newinc_cum_p/10)*10`% of total notifications, with close to half in the South-East Asia Region alone. 

### `r anch("Table 3.1.1")`<span class="red">Table 3.1.1</span> Notifications of TB, HIV-positive TB, MDR/RR-TB and XDR-TB cases, globally and for WHO regions, `r report_year - 1`

The big drop in the total number of people newly diagnosed and officially reported with TB in `r report_year-2` compared with `r report_year-3`, from `r ftb(f3.1.1_txt$c_newinc_y3/1e6)` to `r ftb(f3.1.1_txt$c_newinc_y2/1e6)` million (`r round(f3.1.1_txt$pct_dif,0)`%), was one of the main findings of the *Global Tuberculosis Report `r report_year-1`*. The increase to `r ftb(f3.1.1_txt$c_newinc_y1/1e6)` million in `r report_year-1` (`r lnk("Fig. 3.1.1")`) suggests a partial recovery in TB detection, following the major disruptions to provision of essential TB services caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, notifications in `r report_year-1` were still `r round(f3.1.1_txt$pct_dif2,0)*(-1)`% below the level of `r report_year-3` and there are wide gaps between the estimated number of people who develop TB each year (incident cases) and the number detected and reported, reflecting a mixture of underreporting of detected cases and underdiagnosis. Gaps between notifications and estimates of TB incidence, especially in the 10 countries that account for most of the global gap, are discussed further in <span class="red">Section 3.3</span>.

The global trend of a big decrease in the number of people newly diagnosed with TB in `r report_year-2` and a partial recovery in `r report_year-1` has been driven by trends in the South-East Asia Region. A similar pattern is evident in the Eastern Mediterranean Region and the Region of the Americas; in contrast, there was no recovery in the Western Pacific Region in `r report_year-1`. The African Region stands out as having only a small reduction in TB notifications in `r report_year-2` followed by an increase in `r report_year-1`.

In the 30 high TB burden countries, trends in notifications vary considerably (`r lnk("Fig. 3.1.2")`). In `r report_year-2`, the first full year of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were particularly large absolute and relative reductions in India, Indonesia and Philippines, followed by some recovery in `r report_year-1`. Countries such as Bangladesh and Pakistan experienced large reductions in `r report_year-2` but recovered to above `r report_year-3` levels in `r report_year-1`. In some other Asian countries, such as Thailand and Viet Nam, there was a limited impact on notifications in `r report_year-2` but a large impact in `r report_year-1`; while in others such as Mongolia and Myanmar there were reductions that departed from the historic trend in both `r report_year-2` and `r report_year-1`. In most high TB burden countries in the African Region, notifications either fell in line with the historic trend or increased; an exception is Angola. Further analysis of notification trends during the COVID-19 pandemic is provided in <span class="red">Section 1</span>.

Globally, the cumulative total number of people diagnosed with TB and officially reported from 2018 to `r report_year-1` is `r ftb(f3.1.3_txt$c_newinc/1e6)` million, only `r ftb(f3.1.3_txt$c_newinc*100/40e6)`% of the 5-year target of 40 million between 2018 and 2022 that was set at the UN high-level meeting on TB in 2018 (`r lnk("Fig. 3.1.3")`). The target for detection and treatment of people with drug-resistant (DR) TB appears even further out of reach, as are the targets for treatment of children specifically.

Most notified cases of TB are among adults (`r lnk("Fig. 3.1.4")`). Of the global total of people with a new or relapse episode of TB who were notified in `r report_year - 1`, `r ftb(f3.1.4_txt$pct_m)`% were men, `r ftb(f3.1.4_txt$pct_f)`% were women and `r ftb(f3.1.4_txt$pct_c)`% were children (aged 0&#8211;14 years). In general, notification data appear to understate the share of the TB disease burden accounted for by men, since higher M:F ratios among adults have been found in national TB prevalence surveys (<span class="red">Section 2.4</span>).

The global male:female (M:F) ratio for TB notifications in `r report_year - 1` was `r ftb(f3.1.5_txt$mf_ratio)`. The distribution of notified cases by age and sex varies among WHO regions (`r lnk("Fig. 3.1.5")`).

<br />
There is considerable country variation in the proportion of notified cases that are children (`r lnk("Fig. 3.1.6")`). There are recognized issues with the diagnosis and reporting of TB in children, including the use of variable case definitions and underreporting of cases diagnosed by paediatricians in the public and private sectors. Greater attention to the quality of TB notification data for children is warranted in many countries.

There is also considerable country variation in the proportion of notified cases that are diagnosed with extrapulmonary TB (`r lnk("Fig. 3.1.7")`). This may reflect underlying differences in TB epidemiology as well as diagnostic practices.

<br />
Engagement of all care providers in the public and private sectors through public–private mix (PPM) initiatives can help to minimize the underreporting of people diagnosed with TB. Since 2015, the contribution of such initiatives to total notifications has grown in most of the seven countries defined as top global priorities for PPM (`r lnk("Fig. 3.1.8")`).

Community engagement can help with referrals of people with TB symptoms to health facilities as well as treatment support; in `r filter(f3.1.9_data, dc_engage_community_display==1) %>% nrow()` countries from which WHO requested data in `r report_year-1`, such engagement was reported in a high proportion of basic management units (`r lnk("Fig. 3.1.9")`).

Case-based digital surveillance systems enable timely reporting and use of TB data. The current status of progress in transitioning from paper-based aggregated reporting systems to case-based digital surveillance is shown in `r lnk("Fig. 3.1.10")`. Acceleration of progress in making this transition is needed in the African Region.
