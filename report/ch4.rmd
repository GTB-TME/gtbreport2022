# 4. TB prevention


_Draft! Prepared `r Sys.Date()` using country-reported data CSV files dated `r csv_datestamp` (and HIV TPT file dated `r csv_tpt_fix_datestamp`_

Preventing tuberculosis (TB) infection and stopping progression from infection to disease are critical to reduce TB incidence to the levels envisaged by the End TB Strategy. The main health care interventions to achieve this reduction are TB preventive treatment, which the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends for people living with HIV, household contacts of people with TB and other risk groups (`r ref_lnk("1")`); TB infection prevention and control (`r ref_lnk("2")`); and vaccination of children with the bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine. Addressing broader determinants that influence TB epidemics can also help to prevent TB infection and disease; these are discussed in <span class="red">Section 6.3</span>.


## TB preventive treatment: overall status of progress

The global number of people living with HIV and household contacts of people diagnosed with TB who were provided with TB preventive treatment increased from `r ftb(f4.1_txt$tot_tpt_2015/1e6)` million in 2015 to `r ftb(f4.1_txt$tot_tpt_2019/1e6)` million in 2019, after which there was a sizeable reduction in 2020 (to `r ftb(f4.1_txt$tot_tpt_2020/1e6)` million) followed by an almost complete recovery in 2021 (to `r ftb(f4.1_txt$tot_tpt_2021/1e6)` million), probably reflecting disruptions to health services caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (`r lnk("Fig. 4.1")`). Most of those being provided with TB preventive treatment are people living with HIV. The number of children under 5 provided with TB preventive treatment has not increased substantially over the last three years; in contrast, `r ftb(f4.1_txt$tot_con_tpt_2021/1e3)`\ 000 household contacts aged 5 years and over were started on TB preventive treatment in 2021, a `r ftb(f4.1_txt$con_21_20_pct)`% increase compared to the `r ftb(f4.1_txt$tot_con_tpt_2020/1e3)`\ 000 that started treatment in 2020.

Progress made in the past 4 years lags far behind that needed to reach the global target set at the UN high-level meeting on TB (`r lnk("Fig. 4.2")`). Although the sub-target for people living with HIV had been achieved by 2020, further scale-up will be needed to reach the target of providing TB preventive treatment to 90% of people living with HIV by 2025 (`r ref_lnk("3")`), which was reaffirmed at the 2021 UN high-level Meeting on HIV and AIDS (`r ref_lnk("4")`).

Ensuring access to shorter rifapentine-containing regimens may help to increase access to TB preventive treatment. By June 2022, `r f4.3_txt$countries_used` countries reported that they had used shorter rifapentine-containing regimens (including trials and subnational projects) (`r lnk("Fig. 4.3")`). In 2021, over `r ftb(f4.3_txt$people_tx_2021)` individuals started shorter regimens in `r f4.3_txt$country_tx_2021` countries. Rifapentine-based regimens were used in `r f4.3_txt$rifapentine` countries  (mostly a 3-month weekly regimen of rifapentine and isoniazid); `r f4.3_txt$rifampicin` countries reported using a rifampicin-based regimen.

## Household contacts

Globally in 2021, `r ftb(f4.4_txt$newinc_con_2021/1e6)` million contacts of bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB cases were reported (up `r ftb(f4.4_txt$change_con_21_20_pct)`% from `r ftb(f4.4_txt$newinc_con_2020/1e6)` million in 2020), of whom `r ftb(f4.4_txt$newinc_con_screen_2021/1e6)` million (`r ftb(f4.4_txt$screened_pct_2021)`%) were evaluated for both TB infection and disease (up `r ftb(f4.4_txt$change_screen_21_20_pct)`% from `r ftb(f4.4_txt$newinc_con_screen_2020/1e6)` million in 2020). The percentage of contacts who were evaluated varied widely among countries (`r lnk("Fig. 4.4")`). There is considerable variation in the coverage of TB preventive treatment for eligible children aged under 5 years (`r lnk("Fig. 4.5")`). Data on treatment completion among household contacts were reported by `r f4.6_txt$countries` countries; the median completion rate was `r ftb(f4.6_txt$median)`% (IQR, `r ftb(f4.6_txt$q1)`–`r ftb(f4.6_txt$q3)`%) but varied widely (`r lnk("Fig. 4.6")`).

## People living with HIV

Most of those provided with TB preventive treatment to date have been people living with HIV (`r lnk("Fig. 4.1")`). Globally, the annual number increased from fewer than 30\ 000 in 2005 to `r ftb(f4.7_txt$hiv_tpt_2019/1e6)` million in 2019 before falling in 2020 and 2021 (to `r ftb(f4.7_txt$hiv_tpt_2020/1e6)` million and `r ftb(f4.7_txt$hiv_tpt_2021/1e6)` million respectively) (`r lnk("Fig. 4.7")`). Between 2005 and the end of 2021, `r ftb(f4.7_txt$hiv_tpt_05_21/1e6)` million people living with HIV were initiated on TB preventive treatment, equivalent to about `r ftb(f4.7_txt$hiv_tpt_05_21*100/38.4e6)`% percent of the 38 million people estimated to be living with HIV in 2021 (`r ref_lnk("5")`). There were reductions in most WHO regions between 2019 and 2020, with recovery only in the African and Eastern Mediterranean regions in 2021 (`r lnk("Fig. 4.7")`).

## Tests for TB infection

In 2021, `r f4.10_data %>% filter(infection_tests_used %in% c(177, 175, 176)) %>% nrow()` countries reported using tuberculin skin tests (TST) or interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) in either the public or private sectors to deliver TB preventive treatment to populations at risk (`r lnk("Fig. 4.10")`). Of the `r f4.10_data %>% filter(infection_tests_used == 194) %>% nrow()` countries reporting no use of tests of TB infection, `r f4.10_data %>% filter(infection_tests_used == 194 & g_whoregion == 'AFR') %>% nrow()` were in the WHO African Region.

## TB infection prevention and control

The risk of TB among health care workers relative to the risk in the general adult population is one of the indicators recommended by WHO for measuring the impact of interventions for TB infection prevention and control in health care facilities. If effective prevention measures are in place, the risk ratio for TB in health care workers compared with the general adult population should be close to 1. In 2021, `r int_spacer(f4.11_txt$tot_hcw_tb)` health care workers from `r f4.11_txt$countries_hcw_tb` countries were reported to have been diagnosed with TB. The ratio of the TB notification rate among health care workers to the general adult population was greater than 1 in `r f4.11_txt$countries_nrr` countries that reported five or more TB cases among health care workers (`r lnk("Fig. 4.11")`).

## BCG vaccination

BCG vaccination is recommended as part of national childhood immunization programmes, in line with a country’s TB epidemiology. Global coverage dropped from `r f4.12_txt$bcg_cov_2019`% in 2019 to `r f4.12_txt$bcg_cov_2021`% in 2021, most likely due to disruptions to health services caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (`r lnk("Fig. 4.12")`).
